## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#5850EB) to represent intelligence, clarity, and trust. This color creates a modern and authoritative feel.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E8EAF6). This provides a clean, professional backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Complementary orange (#FF6D00) for call-to-actions, highlights, and areas needing emphasis. This color enhances user interaction by drawing attention to actionable elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. The former conveys a modern feel while the latter is extremely legible, which is important when presenting documentation.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent different aspects of product documentation. The icons should be monochromatic in the primary color to maintain consistency.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure information is presented in an organized and easily digestible manner. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through the presentation. Use animations to highlight key points and emphasize important information.
